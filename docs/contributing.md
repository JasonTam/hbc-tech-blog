### Create a new post

To create a new post, please create a new branch for your post and save the **markdown** file in `_posts` of your branch. Use the following naming convention for blog posts: YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-name.md

Note that the Markdown source file for each post has an header section with some auto-generated metadata (layout, title, author, date, categories, tags). Please always add the metadata as follows:

```
layout: post
title: "Enter Your Title Here"
author: First Last
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
categories: 'just one'
tags: 
- your
- tags
- here
```

After uploading your blog post to the _posts_ folder of the new branch, submit a pull request. After solicting feedback from your peers and editing the post, you're ready to merge.
